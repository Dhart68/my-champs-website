### Welcome to my short repo to get last info of your favorit nba players

Using nba_api the nba-champs-main.py
provides informations about a selected players and urls of video of the last game

nba-champs-main.py has to be run to get the name of the selected player
name should be full : first name, last name (exemple : 'victor wembanyama')
Should be an active player, 'michael jordan' will not work

This repo will back a future streamlit web page


# nba-champs-main.py combines 2 functions :
- player_last_stats : to get the stats of the last 3 games of any nba players
- get_mp4_urls : to get the list of the video of the last game played by the selected player


# A streamlit webapp
